## 3. API Design Patterns

### Request-Response

The **Request-Response** pattern is the most common API interaction model. It involves a client sending a request to the server, which processes the request and returns a response.

**Use Cases:**
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Data retrieval and submission.

### Pagination

**Pagination** is used to divide large sets of data into manageable chunks. It improves performance and user experience by loading data in segments rather than all at once.

**Strategies:**
- **Offset-Based Pagination**: Using page numbers and offsets.
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: Using cursors to navigate through data sequentially.

### Rate Limiting

**Rate Limiting** controls the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specific timeframe. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and protects the server from being overwhelmed.

**Implementation Techniques:**
- **Fixed Window**: Limiting requests in fixed time intervals.
- **Sliding Window**: Continuously tracking request rates over a sliding time window.

### API Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication** verifies the identity of users or applications accessing the API, while **Authorization** determines what resources they can access.

**Common Methods:**
- **OAuth 2.0**: A robust framework for token-based authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Compact tokens for securely transmitting information.
- **API Keys**: Simple tokens for identifying clients.

### WebSockets

**WebSockets** provide a persistent, two-way communication channel between the client and server. They are ideal for real-time applications that require continuous data exchange.

**Advantages:**
- Low latency communication.
- Efficient for live updates and notifications.
