  Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or using a
  combination of DevOps tools to build a custom pipeline.
- **Solution**: Evaluate the specific requirements and constraints of the project to
  determine whether leveraging the integrated services of a major provider for
  simplicity and support, or creating a tailored solution with specialized tools for
  greater flexibility and potential cost savings.

## 3. Detailed Pipeline Stages

![Pipeline Stages](./Illustration.png)
1. **Plan**:
   - **Requirement Assessment and Finalization**: Collaborate with stakeholders to gather
     and finalize project requirements, ensuring that all necessary features and constraints
     are clearly defined and understood.
   - **Timeline Estimation and Finalization**: Estimate the timeline for each phase of the
     pipeline design and finalize deadlines to ensure timely delivery and efficient resource
     allocation.
   - **Task Assignment**: Assign specific tasks to team members based on their expertise
     and roles, facilitating a structured and organized approach to pipeline development
2. **Source Code Management**:

   - **Action**: Developers write and commit code to a Git repository.
   - **Tools**: Git platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; integrated development
     environments (IDEs) such as VS Code and IntelliJ; and local development environments
     for efficient coding and testing.
   - **Best Practices**: Implement branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow) and enforce code
     reviews to maintain code quality and facilitate collaboration.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:

   - **Build**:
     - **Action**: Jenkins automatically triggers a build process upon code commits.
     - **Details**: The build stage compiles the code, resolves dependencies, and packages
       the application, ensuring that the codebase remains in a deployable state.
